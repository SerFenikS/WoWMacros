Macros are stored by class in each folder.

Edit the GS-AggietallboyMacros.toc to add/switch custom scripts - by default it loads the CLASS\class.lua macro



If you just want to load one folder, you can extract just that folder, but you have to rename it to be the same as the .toc file

So for example, if I want to load just the Death Knight macros, I copy "DeathKnight" to my addons folder, and rename it "GS-AggietallboyMacros-DeathKnight"

Then when I load my addons, I see just the DeathKnight macro set.
